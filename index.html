    what is a git branch

    -> a git branch is a pointer to a specific commit within the repositoory. it allows you to work on
    multiple versions of your project simultaneously. each branc is an indeppendent line of development

    
    
    WHY USE BRABCHES

    => isolation: branches allow u to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiment without affecting the main codebase
    => collaboration: different team members can work on diff features simultaneously by creating separate branche
    => experimentation: branches are great for trying out new ideas without disrupting the main code base
    => versioning: u can use branches to maintain different versions of your project simultaneously
